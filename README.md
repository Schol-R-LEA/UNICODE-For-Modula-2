# UNICODE-For-Modula-2
A lightweight UNICODE API for Modula-2.

Forked from an earlier GNU Modula-2 library project by Chris Lilley.

This library intends to support UNICODE Level 1. Extension to Level 2 or higher (e.g., support for bidirectional text, combining characters, etc.) is not planned at this time, but may be pursued at some future point.
